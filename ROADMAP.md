# Roadmap

> _Empathy in our design. Excellence in our code. Generosity in our products. Surprise in our service._

## Purpose
Icarus is a client portal for clients of [Zero Daedalus custom web solutions](https://zerodaedalus.com). The goal is to provide a tool for users to manage their hosting services.

## Objectives

- *Intuitive UI*
- *Minimal Downtime*
- *Complete Transparency*

## Current Milestone
**Admin Interface**

> Quick access to all relevant info to complete basic administration tasks (reviewing and modifying information or links between data.)

## Future Milestones

**E2E and Unit Testing**
> An robust testing suite that automatically runs before commits, merges and building deployments.

**Usability and Downtime**
> Incorporate monitoring of key metrics like downtime and traffic analytics so we can improve UX.

**Error-Handling and Communication**
> Streamline how errors (and other event messages) are handled and communicated to both the user and the developer.

**Podcast Hosting Service**
> Looking to offer an exclusive podcast hosting service with a simple UI for submitting new episodes.

**Social Login**
> Allow users to log in using Facebook or Google accounts for security purposes.

**Continuous Deployment**
> Automatically pulling development builds into the staging server for testing and new master builds into production after testing.

**Automated Server Creation**
> Currently, when new clients register, I provision and configure the server on Linode manually. Using [Stackscripts](https://www.linode.com/stackscripts), I'll automate that process.

**Automated Server Upgrade/Downgrade**
> Same as the above but with the seamless transfer from one instance to another with minimal human intervention.

**New User Registration**
> Allow new users to sign up for basic hosting services. Should also include a CTA to upsell custom solutions.

**Website Education and News**
> Provide regular information that users may find useful in running their websites. Video, Audio and Text.

## Completed Milestones
~**Basic Interface**~
> A simple interface that allows users to easily monitoring their resource usage and renew any services that are nearing expiration.
